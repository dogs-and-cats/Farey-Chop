# Farey
A [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) based approach using logic of the [Farey Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence) can be used to take any given decimal and convert it into an equivalent fraction. 

### Example: 
```console
$ lua ./src/farey.lua
